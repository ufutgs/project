# 50.054 Project Lab 2 (10%)

## Deadline - 26 Nov 2023 23:59

In the previous lab, we completed the parser and ir code generation.

In this lab, we look into the dynamic and static semantics of the SIMP language.

## Tasks for this Lab

The two main tasks for this lab include

1. Implementing an interpreter of SIMP programs.
1. Implementing a type inference for SIMP programs

There is no obvious dependency between the two tasks, hence you can divide the task among your team members if you wish to.

## Task 1 - SIMP interpreter

An interperter takes an ir of a program (AST, or Pseudo Assembly) and the input and runs the program ir form and returns the result.

Typically an interpreter implementation can derived based on the operational semantics. 

In `src/main/scala/sutd/compiler/simp/interpreter/PAInt.scala`, we implemented an interpreter of Pseudo Assembly in Small Step Operational Semantics. We recommend you to study the code in `PAInt.scala` and `src/test/scala/sutd/compiler/simp/TestPAInt` to understand how the algorithm was implemented. There is no modification required to these two files.

As a backup and for practice purposes, we would like to implement an interpreter of SIMP (from SIMP AST). 

In `src/main/scala/sutd/compiler/simp/interpreter/SIMPInt.scala`, we find the partially implemented interpreter using Big Step Operational Semantics of SIMP. 

### Sub Task 1.1

The `evalExp` function evaluates a SIMP expression to a constant by implementing the 
$\Delta \vdash E \Downarrow c$ rules introduced in the notes.

The function is nearly complete except that there are a few cases missing. 

Your task is to complete the implementation.

Upon completion, you should be able to pass the two test cases for `evalExp`.

```bash
sbt compile "testOnly sutd.compiler.simp.TestSIMPInt -- -z evalExp" 
```
### Sub Task 1.2

The `eval` function evaluates a SIMP statement to a value environment by implementing the  $(\Delta, S) \Downarrow \Delta'$ rules.

Due to the definition of the statement AST, we need to overload `eval` for single statement and multiple statments.

Your task is to complete the implementation of the type class instances `evalMany` and `evalOne`.


##### Testing the SIMP interpreter implementation 

Now you should be able to pass all test cases in `src/test/scala/sutd/compiler/simp/TestSIMPInt.scala`


## Task 2 - SIMP Type Inference

In this task we look into the static semantics of the SIMP programming language.


The codes of concern in this task are in `src/main/scala/sutd/compiler/simp/semantics/TypeInf.scala`

Recall the typing constructs for SIMP

$$
\begin{array}{rccl}
 {\tt (Variable)} & X & ::= & a \mid b \mid c \mid d \mid ... \\ 
 {\tt (Types)} & T & ::= & int \mid bool  \\ 
 {\tt (Extended\ Types)} & \hat{T} & ::=  &\alpha \mid T \\ 
 {\tt (Type\ Environments)} & \Gamma & \subseteq & (X \times T) \\ 
 {\tt (Constraints)} & \kappa & \subseteq & (\hat{T} \times \hat{T}) \\ 
 {\tt (Type\ Substitution)} & \Psi & ::= & [\hat{T}/\alpha] \mid [] \mid \Psi \circ \Psi 
\end{array}
$$

We encode the simple (non-extended) type as

```scala
enum Type {
    case IntTy
    case BoolTy
}
```

We encode the extended type as 

```scala
enum ExType {
    case MonoType(t:Type)
    case TypeVar(n:String)
}
```

then the type environment can be modelled via a dictionary mapping from variable to type.

```scala
type TypeEnv = Map[Var, Type]
```

The type constraints can be modelled as a set of pairs of extended types.

```scala
type TypeConstrs = Set[(ExType, ExType)]
```

Lastly the type substitution is a sequence of mapping type variable name to extended type.

```scala
enum TypeSubst {
    case Empty // [] 
    case RevComp(s:(String, ExType), psi:TypeSubst) //  psi compose s
}
```

As per mentioned in the notes, during the type inference, we create skolem type variable $\alpha_x$ for (data value) variable $x$. In the implementation, we have `TypeVar("x")` as the skolem type variable for variable `Var("x")`, i.e. they share the same name.

### Sub Task 2.1 - Substitution

In this task, you need to implement the type substitution

$$
\begin{array}{rcll}
[]\hat{T} & = & \hat{T} \\ 
[\hat{T}/\alpha]\alpha & = & \hat{T} \\  
[\hat{T}/\alpha]\beta & = & \beta & if\ \alpha \neq \beta \\
[\hat{T}/\alpha]T & = & T
\end{array}
$$

Type substiution can be *compositional*.

$$
\begin{array}{rcll}
 (\Psi_1 \circ \Psi_2) \hat{T} & = & \Psi_1(\Psi_2(\hat{T}))
\end{array}
$$

To do that, we define a type class `Substitutable[A]` which allows us to overload the `applySubst` function to different parameter types.

Your task here is to complete the implementation of type class instance `exTypeSubstitutable`.

Upon completion, you should be able to pass the four test cases for `substitution`.

```bash
sbt compile "testOnly sutd.compiler.simp.TestTypeInf -- -z substitution" 
```

### Sub Task 2.2 - Unification

The output of the type inference algorithm is a set of type constraints.

Solving the set of type constraint via unification produces the type substitution that grounds all the skolem type variables.

$$
\begin{array}{rcl}
mgu(int, int) & = & [] \\ 
mgu(bool, bool) & = & [] \\ 
mgu(\alpha, \hat{T}) & = & [\hat{T}/\alpha] \\ 
mgu(\hat{T}, \alpha) & = & [\hat{T}/\alpha] \\
\end{array}
$$

and

$$
\begin{array}{rcl}
mgu(\{\}) & = & [] \\ 
mgu(\{(\hat{T_1}, \hat{T_2})\} \cup \kappa ) & = & let\ \Psi_1 = mgu(\hat{T_1}, \hat{T_2}) \\ 
& & \ \ \ \ \ \ \kappa'  = \Psi_1(\kappa) \\ 
& & \ \ \ \ \ \ \Psi_2   = mgu(\kappa') \\ 
& & in\  \Psi_2 \circ \Psi_1  
\end{array}
$$

Since `mgu` needs to be overloaded, we define a type class `Unifiable[A]`. 

Your task is to complete the type class instances `extypesUnifiable` and `listUnifiable`.

Upon completion, you should be able to pass the four test cases for `unification`.

```bash
sbt compile "testOnly sutd.compiler.simp.TestTypeInf -- -z unification" 
```

### Sub Task 2.3 - Inference

The type class instance method `infStmt.infer` implements the $S \vDash \kappa$ rules.

Type function `infExp` implements the $E \vDash \hat{T}, \kappa$ rules.

Your task is to complete the above two by implementing the missing cases.


#### Testing the Type Inference Implementation

Now you should be able to pass all test cases in `src/test/scala/sutd/compiler/simp/TestTypeInf.scala`


## Everything So far

We should now be able to build an interpreter. 
Check out the code at `src/main/scala/Main.scala`.

To build it

```bash
sbt package
```

Let's make a simple simp program called `fib.simp`

```java
x = input;
f = 0;
s = 1;
c = 0;
t = 0;
while c < x {
    t = f;
    f = s;
    s = t + f;
    c = c + 1;
}
return s;
```
Running 
```bash
scala jar target/scala-3.3.0/simp_3-0.0.1.jar -i fib.simp 5
```

should produce `8` as output.
